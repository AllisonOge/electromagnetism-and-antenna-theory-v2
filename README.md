# Electromagnetism and Antenna theory v2
A book for undergrads at the department of electrical and electronic engineering, University of Benin for the course code EEE 576. The book is written in latex and the next section gives the setup guide

## Quick Start
To compile the latex files you need MikTeX and a text editor like TeXstudio or TeXworks. Install MikTeX from the official [site](https://miktex.org/download) based on your local machine and repeat the same steps for [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks/) or [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) depending on which you prefer. 

Next fork the repository and make your changes. Then create a pull request and I will respond as quickly as possible. If all these jargon is new to you then I suggest you spend a little time understanding how pull request (PR) works with these videos, [understanding PRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=For9VtrQx58) and [creating a PR in GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ).
